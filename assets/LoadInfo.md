## Anomaly detection dashboard

## About The Project

The Dashboard is designed to detect anomalous datapoints in complex timeseries and provide quick insight through meaningful plots.

### Built With

The Dashboard was constructed using the following libraries and tools,
* [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage
To run place .xlsx files in data/RawData then run the python script.

1. Run,
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

Demo data can be generated with,

1. 
  ```
  python DemoDat.py 
  ```
Then the generated .xlsx files can be moved into data/RawData. This is done automatically with the install script.
Details about tabs,

*  *Variables*

  Plots up to 6 features located in data/RawData. Slider highlights and updates statistics on the left hand side of the plot. Radio select "Rescale" mean centers all plotted data.
* *Fourier Anaylsis*

  Demo tab showcasing the anaylsis leading to the alpha anaylsis in the following tab. It's possible to play around with the window size and locaion using the slider. In the upper plot the power spectrum is displayed and fitted. With key statistics on the left.
* *Alpha Anaylsis*

  Run the Alpha anaylsis on individual features by clicking run in the upper right corner or alternatively click in the lower corner to run on all.
* *BOCPD Anaylsis*

  Bayesian Online Change Point Detection. Run on individual features by clicking run in the upper right corner or alternatively click in the lower corner to run on all.
* *PCA Anaylsis*

  Run the PCA anomaly detection algorithum on data/RawData, data/AlphaData or data/BOCPDData. Only possible to select combinations that have been generated by running the previous tab anaylsis.
